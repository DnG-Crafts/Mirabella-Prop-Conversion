# Firework Light


A conversion for the <a href=https://www.mirabella.com.au/mirabella-product-item/firework-light/>Firework Light</a><br>

This conversion is pretty simple, you just open the center piece and remove the two chips in the red circles to disable the build in controller and then add a plug/pigtail for a ws2811 controller.

The prop contains 5 volt seed pixels, 8 pixels in each arm with 12 arms for a total of 96 pixels and the xmodel for prop is in this repo.
