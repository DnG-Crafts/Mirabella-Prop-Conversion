# Christmas Light Show Tree


A full seed pixel conversion for the <a href=https://www.mirabella.com.au/mirabella-product-item/christmas-light-show-tree/>Christmas Light Show Tree</a><br>

This prop comes with dumb leds so they need to be replaced with seed pixels.

You use the frame and springs from the prop and 3D print a new topper in PETG using the stl in this repo(supports required)

I used seed pixels with 5cm spacing so it made a total of 816 pixels spread over 2 ports with 408 pixels per port to maintain 40fps if needed.
